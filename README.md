# Jest Test Suite

After having gone through a theoretical exercise with Jest matchers in a
self-contained test file, I am now attempting to create a Jest test spec
for multiple matchers based on the self-contained matchers test file,
but in this case testing a module against the test spec, which would be
modeled more acccurately on practices of the development community.
